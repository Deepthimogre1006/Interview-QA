1: What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design documents on the 
World Wide Web. It structures web content and tells the browser how to display text, images, and other forms of multimedia.

Example:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>


2: What is the use of Doctype?

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is used to specify the HTML version used in the document. 
It ensures that the web page is rendered correctly and consistently across different browsers.

Example:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>HTML5 Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>This is a valid HTML5 document.</p>
</body>
</html>



3: What are elements and attributes?

Elements: HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. 
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

Example:

html
Copy code
<p>This is a paragraph element.</p>

Attributes: Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
 They are included in the opening tag and usually come in name/value pairs.

Example:

html
Copy code
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>

<br>


4: Explain tags in HTML:

Tags are the HTML code that defines elements. They are enclosed in angle brackets, for example, 
<h1>, <p>, and <div>. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag (<tagname>) and a closing tag (</tagname>),
 although some tags are self-closing.

Example:

html
Copy code
<h5>This is a heading tag</h5>
<p>This is a paragraph tag.</p>


5: Difference between block and inline elements:

Block elements: These elements take up the full width available and always start on a new line.

Example:

html
Copy code
<div>This is a block element.</div>
<p>This is another block element.</p>

 Inline elements: These elements only take up as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line.

Example:

html
Copy code
<span>This is an inline element.</span>
<a href="#">This is another inline element.</a>

<br>

6: Difference between semantics and non-semantics elements:

Semantic elements: These elements clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way.

Example:

html
Copy code
<header>
  <h3>This is a header</h3>
</header>
<article>
  <p>This is an article.</p>
</article>


Non-semantic elements: These elements donâ€™t provide clear meaning about their content.

Example:

html
Copy code
<div>This is a non-semantic element.</div>
<span>This is another non-semantic element.</span>

<br>

7: Difference between readonly and disabled:

Readonly: A readonly attribute on an input element means the user can see the 
value but cannot modify it. It still sends the data when the form is submitted.

Example:

html
Copy code
<input type="text" value="readonly" readonly>


Disabled: A disabled attribute on an input element means the user cannot interact with it,
 and it does not send data when the form is submitted.

Example:

html
Copy code
<input type="text" value="disabled" disabled>

<br>

8: Use of required attribute:

The required attribute in HTML is used on input elements to specify that the user must 
fill out the field before submitting the form.

Example:

html
Copy code
<input type="text" required>

<br>

9: Explain anchor tag and its attributes:

The <a> (anchor) tag is used to create hyperlinks.
The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. Other attributes include target 
(specifies where to open the linked document), title (additional information about the link), and
rel (relationship between the current document and the linked document).

Example:

html
Copy code
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank" title="Example">Visit Example</a>

<br>
10: How to embed an image on a webpage:

The <img> tag is used to embed an image on a webpage. The src attribute specifies the path to the image,
 and the alt attribute provides alternative text if the image cannot be displayed.

Example:

html
Copy code
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">
<br>

11: What is a list, types of lists, and how to display a list in HTML:

Lists: HTML supports ordered lists, unordered lists, and definition lists.
Ordered lists: Use the <ol> tag, with list items inside <li> tags.

Example:

html
Copy code
<ol>
  <li>Apple</li>
  <li>Mango</li>
</ol>


Unordered lists: Use the <ul> tag, with list items inside <li> tags.

Example:

html
Copy code
<ul>
  <li>Flipkart</li>
  <li>Meesho</li>
</ul>

 Definition lists: Use the <dl> tag, with terms inside <dt> tags and descriptions inside <dd> tags.

Example:

html
Copy code
<dl>
  <dt>Term 1</dt>
  <dd>Description of Term 1</dd>
</dl>
<br>

12: How to embed audio and video tags:

Audio: Use the <audio> tag with the src attribute, and optionally the controls attribute to display playback controls.

Example:

html
Copy code
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>


Video: Use the <video> tag with the src attribute, and optionally the controls attribute to display playback controls.

Example:

html
Copy code
<video controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>

<br>

13: What is an iframe?

An <iframe> (inline frame) is used to embed another HTML document within the current document.

Example:

html
Copy code
<iframe src="https://www.example.com" width="600" height="400"></iframe>

<br>

14: Semantic tags:

Header: Represents the introductory content or a set of navigational links.

Example:

html
Copy code
<header>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>


Footer: Represents the footer of a section or page.

Example:

html
Copy code
<footer>
  <p>&copy; 2024 My Website</p>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy</a></li>
      <li><a href="#terms">Terms of Service</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</footer>
